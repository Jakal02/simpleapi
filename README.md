# simpleapi
A simple API built for testing out Github CI/CD and deployment practices.

Goals of this repository:

I want to understand how to build a CI/CD pipeline in Github Actions.  
If I understand its full capabilities, it will help me make informed 
decisions on what else I need in my tech stack to make the workflow for a project
feel like a professional one.
